## Description üßÆ

JavaFxCalculator is a simple yet powerful calculator application built using **Java** and **JavaFX**. It leverages the **Stack data structure** to compute mathematical expressions while ensuring the correct **order of operations** (PEMDAS) is followed. The core algorithm uses **postfix notation** (Reverse Polish Notation) for efficient expression evaluation.

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses for grouping.
- Follows the correct order of operations using a custom **postfix notation** algorithm.
- Sleek and interactive UI built with **JavaFX**.
- Styled using **CSS** for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and improved UI/UX.

## Getting Started üöÄ
